=================

```
simple_brute [min_length] [max_length] arg1 arg2 arg3...

l - letters
c - caps
n - numbers
s - special characters
```

A simple string generation program for use with brute force attacks and whatnot. It works now. Next, I want to make it smaller, add progress saving functionality and a few other things.

Also, I would love some feedback on this.
