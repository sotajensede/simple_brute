```
ssg [min_length] [max_length] arg1 arg2 arg3...

l - letters
c - caps
n - numbers
s - special characters
```

This is more or less some coding practice for me between semesters. This is a simple (and unfinished/nonfuncional) word generation program for use with brute force attacks and whatnot.

```
array_test.cpp
```

is where I've been testing the algorithm for generating the 2d array for output that is formed based on user parameters. Eventually it will be merged with

```
ssg.cpp
```
