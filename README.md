simple_string_gen
=================

This is more or less some coding practice for me between semesters. This is a simple (and unfinished/nonfuncional) word generation program for use with brute force attacks and whatnot.

```
array_test.cpp
```

is where I've been testing the algorithm for generating the 2d array for output that is formed based on user parameters. Eventually it will be merged with

```
ssg.cpp
```
